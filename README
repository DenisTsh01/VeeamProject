  First of all, thank you for this opportunity to work on such interesting mini-project, I really liked it.
I chose to use python because I know better its libraries, I used 'os' before for my personal project (but
not as "complex" as here, I am sure more sofisticated can be done), whereas in C++, I used it for OOP.

  I created a function "sync" to perform create/update/add/remove operations (even if it wasn't mentioned in 
the task, if the folder doesn't exist it will create one).
Based on the demand (update remove etc. ) it will print the message and it will be written in the log file.
I didn't know exactly where log file should be, but even if it is in 'mainfolder' or outside it it will work perfectly. 
I ran into a case where updating files was before writing in log file and it kept updating but I solved it. 
I chose to implement apscheduler because I knew about it but I didn't have the opportunity to use it in my personal project 
yet, and I found it interesting to use it here.

  I am looking forward to join your team, and I can't wait to help the department while accumulating precious knowledge about this niche.
Thank you!
